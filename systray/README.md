#  systray for windows(trayicon/menu extras)
Originally forked from the [xilp/systray](https://github.com/xilp/systray) project.
And merged some codes from the forkers(AnimationMenntor/systray,ToadKing/systray). 

This library only works for windows, because this project need systray only in windows.
Due to the Original repo hardly maintained, and considerate of the consistence of codes, I add this module.
